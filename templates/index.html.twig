<h3>Welcome to the Guild Wars 2 Spidy website!</h3>
<p>This website aims to provide you with graphs of the sale and buy listings of items on the Guild Wars 2 Trade Market.
</p>
<p>Using this information we can get a better understanding of the economy in Guild Wars 2. <br />
It can also prevent you from getting caught in other players monopolizing the Trade Market with sudden spikes in prices.
</p>

<h3>You do <em>NOT</em> need to login to use this website!</h3>
<p>I'm using my own game account to gather the information and this website is only showing you what I've gathered over time.
</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>ArenaNet has build the Trade Market so that it's loaded into the game from a website. <br />
You can also access this website with a browser and use your game account to login and view all the items and listings. <br />
<br />
Now what I've build is some tools which will run constantly to automatically login to that website and record all data we can find, <br />
as a result I can record the sale listings for all the items about every hour and with that data I can create graphs with the price changing over time!
</p>
