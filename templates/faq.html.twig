<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h3>Do I need to login to use this website?</h3>
<p><strong>You do <em>NOT</em> need to login to use this website!</strong> <br />
I'm using my own game account to gather the information and this website is only showing you what I've gathered over time.
</p>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>ArenaNet has build the Trade Market so that it's loaded into the game from a website. <br />
You can also access this website with a browser and use your game account to login and view all the items and listings. <br />
<br />
Now what I've build is some tools which will run constantly to automatically login to that website and record all data we can find, <br />
as a result I can record the sale listings for all the items about every hour and with that data I can create graphs with the price changing over time!
</p>

<h3>Can I somehow get access to your data(base)?</h3>
<p>I've created a public API for which you can find the documentation on the <a href="https://github.com/rubensayshi/gw2spidy/wiki">github wiki</a>.</p>
